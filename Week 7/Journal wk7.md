## Response to the Prompts

The concept of "Phygital" objects has been introduced in this course in earlier weeks, but hasn't been defined. When we created digital models of gravestones, we created a phygital object. When we discussed the ethical issues of digital representations of artifacts, those were phygital objects. One obvious potential advantage of creating Phygital objects is the ability to make physical objects accessible to people in a digital space. There are innocent/ethical uses for this such as sending a friend a 3d model I made of my guitar. However, there are also potentially unethical use cases, such as digitizing cultural or religious artifacts that would not otherwise be freely available or accessible to just anyone. 

For this journal entry I want to focus more on what can be *gained* from these technologies. An example that came to mind while reading this weeks materials was the [Notre-Dame fire](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47963835). Ubisoft, the creator of the videogame series "Assassins Creed" had spent 14 months modeling the cathedral before the fire. As a result, Ubisoft was able to use the digital models they created to aid in the reparation of the cathedral. This shows how powerful the digitization of objects or monuments can be, as the "phygital" has the capacity to preserve or restore the physical.
