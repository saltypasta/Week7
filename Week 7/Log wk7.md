# what I was trying to do

_[Raise the dead](https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/7/abm/)


## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

_ Agent-based modeling can be used for theory building or hypothesis testing. This exercise is focused on the former._

## what I did

+ Read  [ODATE 4.4 - 4.4.1.3](https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/artificial-intelligence-in-digital-archaeology.html#agent-based-modeling-abm)
	+ Learned what agent based modeling is on a base level, as well as challenges that face digital archaeologists using agent based modeling (Community lacks conventions about how to communicate models and simulation results)
+ Installed Netlogo
	+ Ran the program, appears there were no issues with installation
+ Began to read through Chapter 1 of the Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree book
	+ Got stuck on understanding the pseudocode 
		+ Took 30mins, then came back and tried to explain what i was reading to my fiance. Her eyes glazed over but it clicked for me!
	+ Made a button
	+ defined procedures
	+ Tried to create turtles, nothing appears
		+ I had an extra "end" at the end of my setup procedure
+ WOAH THE TURTLES ARE MOVING

## challenges 

_Getting a grasp on the terminology and logic of coding took some time to wrap my head around_

## thoughts on where to go next

_I  wonder how modeling can be used in the context of the graveyard project... maybe there is a way to model where gravesites are likely to be located based on environmental factors? How would our decisions regarding the behavior of our agents affect our models? What impact does that have at an ethical level, if our models reflect the bias we carry in the real world? _
